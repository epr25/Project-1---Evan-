    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="images/baskingsharkopenmouth.jpg">
    <p>Picture yourself swimming above the deep ocean, when all of a sudden; you spot a giant shark fin. However, once you go underwater, there is a key feature that tells you everything is ok. A large extendable gaping mouth.</p>
    <p>The animal is none other than a basking shark, which does not see humans as prey. </p> 
    <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
    <li>The basking shark is the second largest shark, and can grow up to 40 feet and weigh up to 5 tons</li>
    <li>It's mouth is used as a filter, as it feeds off of zooplankton: its main source of food</li>
    <li>While the basking shark isn't directly dangerous to humans, their large size and rough skin can pose a risk to the safety of individuals</li>
